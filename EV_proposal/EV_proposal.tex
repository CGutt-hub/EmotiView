\section{Introduction}

% Paragraph 1: General background on emotion, brain-body interaction, clinical relevance - Micro Tweak
The human experience is profoundly shaped by emotions, which orchestrate adaptive responses to environmental challenges and opportunities. Not purely mental events, emotions manifest as complex, integrated states involving subjective feelings, cognitive appraisals, behavioral expressions, and significant physiological changes mediated by the central and \gls{ANS} \parencite{barrettHandbookEmotions2016, kreibigAutonomicNervousSystem2010}. Understanding the dynamic interplay between neural processing and autonomic physiology is fundamental to emotion science \parencite{critchleyNeuralMechanismsAutonomic2005}. This brain-body interaction is not merely epiphenomenal; the perception and regulation of bodily states (interoception) actively contribute to emotional feeling and decision-making \parencite{antoniodamasioDescartesErrorEmotion2005}. Furthermore, disruptions in this neuro-autonomic dialogue, such as altered heart rate variability or electrodermal hypo/hyper-reactivity, are increasingly recognized as core features of affective disorders like anxiety and depression, underscoring the clinical relevance of investigating these mechanisms \parencite{thayerHeartRateVariability2009, beauchaineVagalToneDevelopment2001}.\\

% Paragraph 2: Role of PFC, asymmetry models (motivational direction), BIS/BAS - Micro Tweak
Within the brain, the \gls{PFC} is critical for orchestrating emotional responses, integrating sensory information with internal goals and modulating subcortical affective circuits \parencite{fusterPrefrontalCortex2008}. A prominent theoretical framework focuses on hemispheric asymmetry in \gls{PFC} activity. The motivational direction model posits that relatively greater left \gls{PFC} activation supports approach-related motivation and positive affect, while relatively greater right \gls{PFC} activation underlies withdrawal-related motivation and negative affect \parencite{davidsonWhatDoesPrefrontal2004, harmon-jonesAngerFrontalBrain1996}. This asymmetry is not static but dynamically modulated by emotional context and individual predispositions, such as trait approach/avoidance tendencies captured by the \gls{BIS} and \gls{BAS} scales \parencite{carverBehavioralInhibitionBehavioral1994, suttonPrefrontalBrainAsymmetry1997, rodriguesMindMovementFrontal2018}. The effectiveness of emotional induction methods can also influence the observed asymmetry, suggesting that more engaging stimuli may elicit stronger, more differentiated neural responses \parencite{rodriguesMethodsMatterExamination2021}.\\

% Paragraph 3: Autonomic measures (HRV/ECG/RMSSD, EDA/GSR/SCR/SCL) - Micro Tweaks
While the \gls{PFC} orchestrates central processing, the emotional response simultaneously engages the body via the \gls{ANS}, which adjusts bodily physiology to meet the metabolic and behavioral demands of the situation. Different physiological signals offer complementary views of autonomic activity, reflecting the distinct roles of its two main branches. \gls{HRV}, the analysis of beat-to-beat fluctuations in heart rate derived from \gls{ECG}, provides a non-invasive window into \gls{ANS} function \parencite{malikHeartRateVariability1996, berntsonHeartRateVariability1997}. Metrics focusing on short-term variability, particularly the \gls{RMSSD}, are highly sensitive to rapid, beat-to-beat changes and primarily reflect parasympathetic (vagal) control, crucial for calming and restoration \parencite{malikHeartRateVariability1996, shafferOverviewHeartRate2017}. Higher vagally-mediated \gls{HRV} (indexed by \gls{RMSSD}) generally reflects greater autonomic flexibility and adaptive capacity, linked to effective emotional regulation, while reduced \gls{HRV} is linked to stress, psychopathology, and impaired executive function \parencite{thayerRelationshipAutonomicImbalance2010}. In contrast, sympathetic activity can be captured using \gls{EDA}, also known as \gls{GSR}. \gls{EDA} measures changes in skin conductance driven by sweat gland activity, which is directly innervated by the sympathetic nervous system \parencite{dawsonElectrodermalSystem2007, boucseinElectrodermalActivity2012}. Phasic increases in conductance (\gls{SCR}) reflect event-related sympathetic bursts, while the tonic \gls{SCL} indicates general arousal \parencite{boucseinElectrodermalActivity2012}. Capturing both parasympathetic (\gls{RMSSD}) and sympathetic (\gls{EDA}) influences allows comprehensive assessment of the body's response during emotion.\\

% Paragraph 4: Emotion perception theories (appraisal vs. direct perception), embodied cognition link - Micro Tweak
The perception of emotion itself is also debated. While traditional appraisal theories emphasize cognitive interpretation as the primary determinant of emotional experience \parencite{schererAppraisalProcessesEmotion2001}, alternative perspectives like the direct perception account suggest a more immediate recognition of emotional significance based on characteristic patterns of features, akin to perceptual object recognition \parencite{newenEmotionRecognitionPattern2015}. This view aligns well with theories of embodied cognition, which posit that cognitive processes, including emotional understanding, are grounded in the body's sensorimotor and physiological states \parencite{niedenthalEmbodimentEmotionConcepts2009}. From this perspective, the coordinated activity between neural circuits (like the \gls{PFC}) and autonomic responses (reflected in \gls{RMSSD} and \gls{EDA}) is not just a correlate but an integral part of the emotional percept and experience \parencite{critchleyNeuralMechanismsAutonomic2005}. Understanding how these systems dynamically couple (synchronize) over time is key to understanding the emergence of subjective feeling states. \\

% Paragraph 5: Need for synchrony measures, introduction to PLV - Micro Tweak
Investigating this embodied perspective, where coordinated brain-body activity is integral to emotion, necessitates analytical approaches capturing the temporal coordination (synchrony) between brain and body signals. Neural-autonomic synchrony reflects the functional coupling between central neural oscillations and peripheral physiological rhythms \parencite{thayerHeartRateVariability2009}. Quantifying this synchrony reveals how effectively these systems interact during emotional challenges. The \gls{PLV} is a robust method for this purpose \parencite{lachauxMeasuringPhaseSynchrony1999}. \gls{PLV} measures the consistency of the phase difference between two time series, irrespective of their amplitudes. A high \gls{PLV} indicates consistent phase alignment, suggesting a stable functional interaction. We will calculate \gls{PLV} between the \gls{EEG} signal from the \gls{PFC} and two different autonomic signals: separately with a continuous \gls{HRV}-derived signal (reflecting parasympathetic influence) and with a continuous \gls{EDA}-derived signal (reflecting sympathetic influence). Compared to coherence measures, which are sensitive to both phase and amplitude, \gls{PLV}'s focus on phase makes it particularly adept at detecting transient, potentially non-linear synchronization patterns characteristic of dynamic biological systems responding to stimuli \parencite{cohenAnalyzingNeuralTime2014, valenzaRevealingRealTimeEmotional2014}. The proposed theoretical integration is depicted in \autoref{fig:neuralmodel}.\\

% Paragraph 6: Study aims, multimodal approach justification, stimuli, specific measures (EEG bands, autonomic signals) - Micro Tweak
The present study aims to elucidate neural-autonomic synchrony during the conscious processing of distinct emotional states elicited by validated affective stimuli. We adopt a multimodal approach, integrating high-temporal-resolution \gls{EEG} to capture rapid prefrontal neural dynamics, \gls{ECG} to derive measures of primarily parasympathetic autonomic control (\gls{RMSSD}), \gls{EDA} to reflect sympathetic sudomotor control, and \gls{fNIRS} for complementary spatial localization \parencite{scholkmannReviewContinuousWave2014, pintiCurrentStatusIssues2019}. This combination allows investigating network dynamics while focusing on \gls{EEG}'s temporal resolution for synchrony, \gls{ECG}/\gls{EDA} for specific autonomic branches, and \gls{fNIRS} to localize activity in key prefrontal (emotion regulation) and parietal (attention, bodily signal integration) regions \parencite{pessoaRelationshipEmotionCognition2008, critchleyNeuralMechanismsAutonomic2005}. While technically demanding, this integrated approach is necessary to investigate how precisely timed brain-body coupling relates to activity within specific neural substrates. We acknowledge that linking the hemodynamic response measured by \gls{fNIRS} to the specific neural activity whose phase is relevant for autonomic coupling relies on the assumption that significant hemodynamic changes reflect underlying neural engagement relevant to the synchrony analysis, despite the complex and indirect nature of neurovascular coupling \parencite{logothetisInterpretingBOLDSignal2004}. The \gls{fNIRS} data, therefore, serve not just as post-hoc context, but as a means to spatially constrain and interpret the functional significance of observed \gls{EEG}-based synchrony patterns, as detailed in the analysis plan. We will utilize standardized, emotionally evocative video clips (positive, negative, neutral) from the E-MOVIE database, validated by \textcite{maffeiEMOVIEExperimentalMOVies2019} for their efficacy in inducing targeted affective states. By calculating \gls{PLV} between prefrontal \gls{EEG} oscillations (specifically in the alpha [8-13 Hz] and beta [13-30 Hz] bands, which are broadly implicated in cortical processing, attention, and potentially emotional regulation \parencite{klimeschEEGAlphaTheta1999, koenigMillisecondMillisecondYear2002, allenIssuesAssumptionsRoad2004}) and relevant autonomic signals (including continuous signals derived from \gls{HRV} data reflecting vagal activity for brain-heart coupling and continuous phasic \gls{EDA}-derived signals for brain-sudomotor sympathetic coupling), we will investigate how brain-body interactions involving both \gls{ANS} branches vary with emotional content and intensity.\\

% --- Hypotheses ---
Given these considerations, we hypothesize:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)] % Enumerate hypotheses with (a), (b), etc.
    \item \textbf{Emotional Modulation of Synchrony:} We predict that neural-autonomic synchrony (\gls{PLV}) will be significantly enhanced during the processing of both positive and negative emotional stimuli compared to neutral stimuli. We will investigate this using \gls{PLV} calculated between prefrontal \gls{EEG} and both continuous \gls{HRV}-derived signals (reflecting brain-heart parasympathetic coupling) and \gls{EDA}-derived signals (reflecting brain-sudomotor sympathetic coupling). Rationale: Emotional engagement necessitates greater integration between central command centers and peripheral effectors (cardiac and sudomotor) to prepare for potential action and adapt internal milieu; this heightened integration is expected to manifest as stronger phase coupling involving both \gls{ANS} branches \parencite{critchleyNeuralMechanismsAutonomic2005}. While we predict overall enhancement, we will also exploratorily examine whether the nature or dominant branch of synchrony (e.g., \gls{EEG}-\gls{HRV} vs. \gls{EEG}-\gls{EDA}) differs between positive and negative valence conditions.
    \item \textbf{Synchrony and Subjective Arousal:} We predict a positive correlation between the magnitude of neural-autonomic synchrony and subjective ratings of emotional arousal (via the \gls{SAM}) specifically during the positive and negative conditions. This correlation will be tested for both \gls{PLV} using continuous \gls{HRV}-derived signals (parasympathetic coupling) and \gls{PLV} using \gls{EDA}-derived signals (sympathetic coupling). Rationale: Higher subjective arousal reflects a more intense emotional state, likely involving stronger reciprocal signaling and tighter coupling between the brain's assessment and the body's physiological mobilization. This mobilization involves coordinated adjustments in cardiovascular and sudomotor control (potentially reflected in \gls{EEG}-\gls{HRV} or \gls{EEG}-\gls{EDA} synchrony), leading to more consistent phase relationships between central and peripheral systems \parencite{valenzaRevealingRealTimeEmotional2014, boucseinElectrodermalActivity2012}.
    \item \textbf{Baseline Vagal Tone and Task-Related Synchrony:} We predict that individual differences in baseline parasympathetic regulation, indexed by resting-state \gls{RMSSD}, will be positively associated with the degree of neural-autonomic synchrony (\gls{PLV} calculated specifically between \gls{EEG} and continuous \gls{HRV}-derived signals) exhibited during the processing of negative emotional stimuli. Rationale: Individuals with higher baseline \gls{RMSSD}, indicative of greater vagal regulatory capacity \parencite{thayerRelationshipAutonomicImbalance2010, shafferOverviewHeartRate2017}, may be better equipped to dynamically coordinate neural and cardiac activity when facing demanding or threatening situations, resulting in more robust task-related brain-heart phase synchrony.
    \item \textbf{Frontal Asymmetry and Branch-Specific Synchrony:} We predict that the direction of prefrontal cortical asymmetry, indexed by alpha band [8-13 Hz] power differences (e.g., F3 vs. F4), may be differentially associated with the strength of phase synchrony involving distinct autonomic branches. Specifically, we will exploratorily investigate whether greater relative right \gls{PFC} activation (associated with withdrawal/inhibition) correlates with stronger \gls{EEG}-\gls{HRV} \gls{PLV} (parasympathetic coupling), and whether greater relative left \gls{PFC} activation (associated with approach/action) correlates with stronger \gls{EEG}-\gls{EDA} \gls{PLV} (sympathetic coupling), particularly during emotional conditions. Rationale: This hypothesis explores whether the functional specialization suggested by the motivational direction model \parencite{davidsonWhatDoesPrefrontal2004, harmon-jonesAngerFrontalBrain1996}, typically assessed via power measures, extends to the domain of phase coupling with the autonomic branch potentially most relevant to that motivational state. We acknowledge this is an exploratory step, bridging asymmetry (power) and synchrony (phase) concepts, aimed at generating hypotheses about potential underlying mechanisms linking cortical motivational states to specific patterns of brain-body interaction.

\section{Methods}

% --- Subsection for each modality/aspect ---
\subsection{Electroencephalography} % Micro Tweak
\gls{EEG} measures electrical brain activity via scalp electrodes, capturing voltage fluctuations from synchronized postsynaptic potentials primarily in cortical pyramidal neurons \parencite{sharmaEmergingTrendsEEG2024, chaddadElectroencephalographySignalProcessing2023}. Its excellent temporal resolution (milliseconds) is crucial for capturing the rapid neural dynamics necessary for phase synchrony analysis (\gls{PLV}) with physiological signals \parencite{cohenAnalyzingNeuralTime2014}. While spatial resolution is limited by volume conduction, \gls{EEG} allows tracking oscillatory activity in specific frequency bands linked to cognitive and affective states. In this study, we focus on the Alpha (8-13 Hz) band, often associated with cortical inhibition, attentional processes, and emotional valence processing (particularly in frontal asymmetry contexts \parencite{allenIssuesAssumptionsRoad2004, allenIssuesAssumptionsRoad2004}), and the Beta (13-30 Hz) band, implicated in sensorimotor processing, maintaining the current cognitive set, and potentially arousal states \parencite{klimeschEEGAlphaTheta1999, engelBetaBandOscillationsSignalling2001}. \gls{EEG} will thus provide the primary high-resolution neural signal for assessing frontal asymmetry (via alpha power) and calculating \gls{PLV} (using phase information from both alpha and beta bands).

\subsection{Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy} % Micro Tweak
\gls{fNIRS} measures cerebral hemodynamic changes (\gls{HbO2}, \gls{HbR}) linked to neural activity using near-infrared light \parencite{scholkmannReviewContinuousWave2014, jobsisNoninvasiveInfraredMonitoring1977, obrigVisibleImagingHuman2003}. This linkage, known as neurovascular coupling, reflects the increased metabolic demand and subsequent blood flow changes in active brain regions. Offering spatial information complementary to \gls{EEG} \parencite{pintiCurrentStatusIssues2019}, \gls{fNIRS} allows localizing hemodynamic correlates of neural activity within specific cortical regions. In this study, it will be used to identify prefrontal \gls{ROI} showing significant task-related activation, which will then inform the analysis of \gls{EEG}-autonomic synchrony originating from those functionally defined areas.

\subsection{Electrocardiography and Heart Rate Variability} % Micro Tweak
\gls{ECG} records the heart's electrical activity, allowing derivation of \gls{HRV} by analyzing beat-to-beat variations (\gls{NN intervals}), which reflect \gls{ANS} modulation of heart rate \parencite{malikHeartRateVariability1996, berntsonHeartRateVariability1997}. We will focus on the time-domain metric \gls{RMSSD}, calculated as:
% --- Equation Environment for RMSSD ---
\begin{equation} % Math environment for displayed equations
    \text{\gls{RMSSD}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} (NN_{i+1} - NN_i)^2}
    \label{eq:rmssd} % Label for referencing the equation (\autoref{eq:rmssd})
\end{equation}
where $NN_i$ is the $i$-th interval and $N$ is the number of intervals. \gls{RMSSD} is sensitive to rapid, high-frequency fluctuations in heart rate and primarily reflects parasympathetic (vagal) influence on the heart \parencite{malikHeartRateVariability1996, shafferOverviewHeartRate2017}. Higher resting \gls{RMSSD} generally indicates greater vagal tone and autonomic flexibility \parencite{thayerRelationshipAutonomicImbalance2010}. For the synchrony analysis, a continuous signal representing vagal influence will be derived from the \gls{NN intervals} (e.g., via interpolation) to compute \gls{PLV} with \gls{EEG} signals.

\subsection{Electrodermal Activity} % Micro Tweak
\gls{EDA} (\gls{GSR}) measures skin conductance changes reflecting sympathetic output from sweat glands \parencite{dawsonElectrodermalSystem2007, boucseinElectrodermalActivity2012}. Specifically, it reflects the activity of eccrine sweat glands, which are primarily involved in thermoregulation and emotional sweating, and are solely innervated by the sympathetic nervous system. It indicates arousal and sympathetic activation \parencite{kreibigAutonomicNervousSystem2010}. \gls{EDA} is typically measured via electrodes on the skin surface \parencite{boucseinElectrodermalActivity2012}. The signal includes tonic \gls{SCL} (baseline arousal) and phasic \gls{SCR} (event-related bursts) \parencite{dawsonElectrodermalSystem2007}. As we are interested in the dynamic coupling related to specific emotional events, the continuous phasic \gls{EDA} signal, reflecting these sympathetic bursts, will be the focus for \gls{PLV} analysis.

\subsection{Experimental Setup} % Micro Tweak
This study employs a multimodal approach, simultaneously recording \gls{fNIRS}, \gls{EEG}, \gls{EDA}, and \gls{ECG}. \gls{fNIRS} (NIRSport, 8 sources/7 detectors, 17 channels + short channels \parencite{gagnonShortSeparationChannel2012}) optodes integrated into an \gls{EEG} cap will cover prefrontal and parietal cortices \parencite{chenStrategicIntegrationCrossDisciplinary2024}. This coverage targets key regions for emotional processing (\gls{PFC} \parencite{fusterPrefrontalCortex2008, etkinFunctionalNeuroanatomyAnxiety2011, royFunctionalSpecificityHuman2012}) and parietal areas involved in attention modulation and integrating bodily signals relevant to emotion \parencite{pessoaRelationshipEmotionCognition2008, critchleyNeuralMechanismsAutonomic2005, culhamHumanParietalCortex2006}. While enabling broader network analysis, parietal signals primarily provide context for the focused frontal-autonomic synchrony investigation. Inter-optode distance $\leq$ 3 cm; sampling 7.81 Hz \parencite{scholkmannReviewContinuousWave2014}. \gls{EEG} electrodes (10-20 system with 64 electrodes, excluding optode positions \parencite{sharmaEmergingTrendsEEG2024}) and Polybox-integrated \gls{ECG} (3-lead) / \gls{EDA} (non-dominant hand fingers) modules will record at 1000 Hz \parencite{luckIntroductionEventRelatedPotential2014}. For \gls{EEG} and \gls{fNIRS} electrode placement see \autoref{fig:eegsetup}.

\subsection{Experimental Design} % Micro Tweaks
% Details about stimuli, procedure, randomization, participants
This study utilizes a within-subjects design where participants view emotionally evocative video clips intended to induce positive, negative, or neutral affective states. The stimuli consist of standardized clips selected from the E-MOVIE database \parencite{maffeiEMOVIEExperimentalMOVies2019}, chosen for validated effectiveness and translated to German. To manage presentation and minimize order effects, three bundles are created, each containing one randomly ordered scene of each valence (positive, negative, neutral). Bundle presentation order is counterbalanced across participants, with the constraint that the valence of the last scene in one bundle differs from the first scene of the subsequent bundle. We aim to recruit 20-30 participants for this study.

Before the task, participants complete baseline questionnaires (\gls{BIS}/\gls{BAS} \parencite{carverBehavioralInhibitionBehavioral1994, strobelDeutschsprachigeVersionBIS2006}, \gls{PANAS} \parencite{watsonDevelopmentValidationBrief1988,breyerDeutscheVersionPositive2016}). The experimental procedure involves repeating a specific trial structure nine times (once for each scene). Each trial involves: 1-min baseline rest, video clip presentation, 2-min recovery rest, and post-stimulus questionnaires (\gls{SAM} for valence/arousal, emotional adjectives, basic emotion evaluation, familiarity rating \parencite{maffeiEMOVIEExperimentalMOVies2019}). Breaks and fatigue monitoring are included due to session length.

% REVISED Participant Criteria
Participants (target N=20-30) will be right-handed native German speakers (18-30y), screened for neurological/psychiatric history, current psychopharmaceutical use, scalp conditions impeding sensors, and prior brain stimulation participation.

\subsection{Data Analysis and Statistics} % Micro Tweaks
Data analysis will be conducted using the Python scientific ecosystem \parencite{harrisArrayProgrammingNumPy2020, virtanenSciPy10Fundamental2020}, primarily using MNE-Python \parencite{gramfortMEGEEGData2013} for EEG/MEG, NeuroKit2 \parencite{makowskiNeuroKit2PythonToolbox2021} for physiological signal processing, MNE-NIRS \parencite{yucelBestPracticesFNIRS2021} for fNIRS analysis, and `statsmodels` \parencite{seaboldStatsmodelsEconometricStatistical2010} and `pingouin` \parencite{vallatPingouinStatisticsPython2018} for statistics. The significance level will be set at $p < 0.05$. Standard assumptions (e.g., normality, sphericity) will be checked, using corrections (e.g., Greenhouse-Geisser) or non-parametric tests where appropriate \parencite{fieldDiscoveringStatisticsUsing2024}. Effect sizes will be reported for all key findings. Given the multiple hypotheses and comparisons involved, we will primarily control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure \parencite{benjaminiControllingFalseDiscovery1995} applied across relevant families of tests (e.g., ANOVA results, correlation analyses).

\paragraph{Preprocessing and Feature Extraction}
Standard preprocessing pipelines will be applied using the specified Python libraries. \gls{EEG} data will undergo filtering and re-referencing, followed by segmentation relative to stimulus onset. Artifacts (e.g., eye blinks, muscle activity) will be identified and corrected using \gls{ICA} \parencite{delormeEEGLABOpenSource2004}. For \gls{ECG}, data will be filtered, R-peaks detected \parencite{panRealTimeQRSDetection1985}, and \gls{NN intervals} derived to calculate baseline and potentially time-varying \gls{RMSSD} (see \autoref{eq:rmssd}) \parencite{malikHeartRateVariability1996}. \gls{EDA} signals will be filtered and decomposed into tonic (\gls{SCL}) and phasic (\gls{SCR}) components \parencite{benedekDecompositionSkinConductance2010}, with the continuous phasic signal extracted for synchrony analysis \parencite{boucseinElectrodermalActivity2012}. \gls{fNIRS} processing involves converting raw optical density to \gls{HbO2}/\gls{HbR} concentration changes via the modified Beer-Lambert law \parencite{copeSystemLongtermMeasurement1988}, addressing motion artifacts (e.g., using \gls{TDDR} \parencite{scholkmannReviewContinuousWave2014}), filtering (e.g., 0.01-0.1 Hz) to isolate the hemodynamic response, and calculating average concentration changes relative to baseline within predefined prefrontal \gls{ROI}s (e.g., \gls{DLPFC}, \gls{VMPFC} \parencite{etkinFunctionalNeuroanatomyAnxiety2011, royFunctionalSpecificityHuman2012, motzkinVentromedialPrefrontalCortex2015}). These \gls{fNIRS} results will provide spatial context for the \gls{EEG}-based synchrony findings.

\paragraph{Neural-Autonomic Synchrony and Statistical Testing} % Micro Tweaks
Neural-autonomic synchrony will be quantified using \gls{PLV} \parencite{lachauxMeasuringPhaseSynchrony1999} between prefrontal \gls{EEG} signals and continuous representations of autonomic activity. \gls{PLV} measures the consistency of the phase difference $\Delta\phi(t) = \phi_{\text{EEG}}(t) - \phi_{\text{Autonomic}}(t)$ over a time window:
\begin{equation}
    \text{PLV} = \left| \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^{N} \exp(i \cdot \Delta\phi(t)) \right|
    \label{eq:plv} % Added label for PLV
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the number of time points in the window, $i$ is the imaginary unit, and $\phi_{\text{EEG}}(t)$ and $\phi_{\text{Autonomic}}(t)$ are the instantaneous phases of the filtered \gls{EEG} and the respective continuous autonomic signal (derived from \gls{HRV} or \gls{EDA}) at time $t$. For brain-heart (parasympathetic) coupling, the discrete \gls{NN intervals} will be interpolated into a continuous signal (e.g., using cubic splines at 4 Hz, a standard approach \parencite{lagunaPowerSpectralDensity1998a, shafferOverviewHeartRate2017}) via `scipy.interpolate` \parencite{virtanenSciPy10Fundamental2020}. For brain-sudomotor (sympathetic) coupling, the continuous phasic \gls{EDA} signal will be resampled (e.g., to 4 Hz) to match the \gls{HRV}-derived signal's rate. Instantaneous phase will be extracted from filtered \gls{EEG} (Alpha/Beta bands) and continuous autonomic signals via Hilbert transform \parencite{virtanenSciPy10Fundamental2020}. \gls{PLV} (see \autoref{eq:plv}) will then be computed between selected frontal \gls{EEG} channels (e.g., F4/F3, Fp2/Fp1 \parencite{rodriguesMethodsMatterExamination2021}, further refined by \gls{fNIRS} findings as described below) and the continuous \gls{HRV}-derived and phasic \gls{EDA} signals, respectively. The primary analysis window will cover the duration of each stimulus presentation, with comparisons made to \gls{PLV} calculated during the pre-stimulus baseline. Exploratory analyses might examine temporal dynamics within the stimulus period, and surrogate data testing (e.g., phase shuffling \parencite{cohenAnalyzingNeuralTime2014}) may be used to assess significance against chance.

Specific statistical tests will address the hypotheses:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Emotional Modulation:} We will first analyze the \gls{fNIRS} data using a \gls{GLM} approach to identify prefrontal \gls{ROI}s significantly modulated by emotional content (Emotion vs. Neutral contrast) \parencite{yucelBestPracticesFNIRS2021}. \gls{EEG} channels spatially corresponding to these functionally identified ROIs will then be selected \parencite{gramfortMEGEEGData2013}. The primary test for emotional modulation of synchrony will be a repeated measures \gls{ANOVA} on the \gls{PLV} values (\gls{EEG}-\gls{HRV} and \gls{EEG}-\gls{EDA}) from these selected channels, with Emotion (Positive, Negative, Neutral) as the within-subjects factor. Significant effects will be followed by FDR-corrected post-hoc tests. This integrated approach ensures that the synchrony analysis focuses on functionally relevant cortical areas.
    \item \textbf{Synchrony and Arousal:} Pearson correlations will be computed between subjective arousal ratings (\gls{SAM}) and the corresponding trial's \gls{PLV} magnitudes (\gls{EEG}-\gls{HRV} and \gls{EEG}-\gls{EDA} from the functionally defined channels/ROIs), specifically within the positive and negative emotional conditions.
    \item \textbf{Baseline Vagal Tone:} A Pearson correlation will assess the relationship between resting-state \gls{RMSSD} (baseline parasympathetic tone) and the average \gls{EEG}-\gls{HRV} \gls{PLV} observed during the negative emotional condition (using PLV from the functionally defined channels/ROIs).
    \item \textbf{Asymmetry and Branch-Specific Synchrony:} Frontal asymmetry will be quantified using the \gls{FAI}, calculated from alpha band power differences between homologous frontal electrodes (e.g., F4/F3, Fp2/Fp1 \parencite{rodriguesMethodsMatterExamination2021, allenIssuesAssumptionsRoad2004}). The formula is given by:
    \begin{equation}
        \text{FAI} = \ln(P_{\text{Right}}) - \ln(P_{\text{Left}})
        \label{eq:fai} % Label for FAI equation
    \end{equation}
    where $P_{\text{Right}}$ and $P_{\text{Left}}$ represent the alpha band power spectral density at homologous right and left frontal electrode sites, respectively (e.g., $P_{\text{F4}}$ and $P_{\text{F3}}$). We will then exploratorily test for correlations (Pearson) between this \gls{FAI} and the strength of \gls{EEG}-\gls{HRV} \gls{PLV} versus \gls{EEG}-\gls{EDA} \gls{PLV} (from functionally defined channels/ROIs), particularly during emotional conditions, to investigate potential differential links between cortical motivational direction and coupling with specific autonomic branches.
